  <div class="heading">
    <h1> Voter Registration vs Total Population Data </h1>
  </div>

  <!-- PARAGRAPH ---------------------------------------->
  <div class="text-box">
    <p> With elections and politics being top of mind for people lately, and headlines sweeping the news
      about how people are not turning in to vote, I asked myself the question if registration
      is the first issue preventing people from hitting the booth. 
    </p>
  <p> In order of the ten most populated California counties, this graph compares
    the total population (of voting age) to how many are registered to vote. 
  </p>
  <p> Based on the numbers below, poor voter turnout is not a result of low registration numbers, 
    at least for the most populated counties in California. It would be interesting to see the numbers
    for other counties. 
  </p>

  <!-- PARAGRAPH - AGE GROUP GRAPH ---------------------------------------->
  <div class="text-box">
  <p> Next I wondered, what is the age group makeup of those who are registered, and is one age
    group registered to vote more than another? 
  </p>
  <p> This graph shows the same counties but shows the percentage of certain age groups that are registered to vote.

  <h3>In Conclusion:</h3>
  <p> 
    The numbers personally surprised me. I thought those registered to vote would be much lower. If I were 
    to continue browsing data to further analyze my initial question, I would like to compare ethnic groups and 
    political groups and see if registration differs there.
