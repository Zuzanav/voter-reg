    <h1> Voter Registration vs Total Population </h1>
    <h2>by county in California</h2>
  </div>

  <!-- PARAGRAPH ---------------------------------------->
  <div class="text-box">
    <p> With elections and politics being top of mind for people lately, and headlines sweeping the news
      about how people are not turning in to vote, I asked myself the question if registration
      is the first issue preventing people from hitting the booth. 
    </p>
  <p> In order of the ten most populated California counties, this graph compares
    the total population (of voting age) to how many are registered to vote. 
  </p>

  <!-- PARAGRAPH - AGE GROUP GRAPH ---------------------------------------->
  <div class="text-box">
  <p> Next I wondered, what is the age makeup of those registered, and is one age
    group registered to vote more than another? 
  </p>
  <p> This graph shows the same counties but shows the percentage of certain age groups that are registered to vote. Here 
    you can also see that not one county has 100% of their voting-age population registered and teeters around the eightieth percentile.
  </p>

  <h3>In Conclusion:</h3>
  <p> 
    The numbers surprised me. I thought the numbers showing people who are registered to vote would be much lower.
    I also expected the numbers to be heavily skewed to one side with regards to what age group has more registrants.
    What this also tells me is I'd much prefer to look at how many people within their own age group are registered 
    to vote as opposed to comparing them to the entire population. For example, of all the 18-25 year olds in Los Angeles, what percent of them 
    are registered to vote? 
  </p>
  <h3>Expanding this Project...</h3>
  <p> If I were to continue browsing data to further analyze my initial question, I would like to compare ethnic groups and 
    political groups and see if registration differs there. I would also compare the counties with the lowest populations
    to see if there is correlation between population size and registration, or population size and political affiliation.
