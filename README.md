## Description
I was curious to answer the question, is voter registration in California a contributing factor to lower voter turnouts? To answer this, I found relevant data containing county populations and county voter registrants by age. Using the Plotly library, I created a couple of bar charts to help shed some light on my question. 

As is typical, it left me with more questions than answers. Take a look for yourself.
